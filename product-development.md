# Product Development Experience (SaaS / Web / Mobile)

I have extensive experience building SaaS and consumer Web products using Javascript / React:
- I architected and led the development of the [primary acquisition flow](https://start.freedomfinancialnetwork.com/) for Achieve (formerly known as Freedom Financial Network) entirely in React / Javascript. 
- I was Head of Engineering at [Postman](https://www.postman.com), where I led six teams developing numerous product features using React / Javascript.
- I founded the startup Skipcard (no longer in operation), which was an event marketing tool. I led a team of 6 people and designed / architected the product from the ground up using a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS, React Native).
