# Amcat Roofing - Project Summary

Amcat Roofing is a roofing company based in the US that is building out their local presence, but also working towards developing a marketplace for roofers across the country to easily acquire customers. I led the project to develop the first version of their product which was a robust and targetted customer acquisiton funnel to capture leads for roof replacement, repair, and inspection.

## Project Features

Here are some of the key features of this project:

- **Email Integration**: Integrated with Sendgrid to automate the notification of new leads to the sales team.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Leveraged NextJS to optimize the site for SEO and ultra-fast load times and overall fast performance by leveraging Server Side Rendering (SSR).

## Technical Contributions

Here are some of my key technical contributions to this project:

- **Project Setup**: I led the team in setting up the foundation for the project using React, NextJS, and Vercel and establishing the key patterns for implementing pages using Server Side Rendering (SSR).
- **API Integration**: I evaluated the Google Solar API as well as other possible APIs that we could use to pull satellite imagery of a roof and approximate the square footage. After selecting the Google Solar API, I implemented the full integration into the API and used it to estimate roof replacement costs for customers. 
- **Future Development Plans**: I was involved in planning for the next phases of the project, which included developing the interface and backend capabilities for launching the product as a more general-purpose marketplace for roofers across the US.

## Technologies

The Amcat Roofing project involved strategic choices in technology to meet the specific requirements:

**Cloud Services / Hosting**
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**: Deployed as the hosting platform for the project. It offered scalability and ease of use, allowing for seamless integration with Next.JS and continuous deployment from our Github repositories.

**APIs**
- **[Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps)**: Used the Google Maps API to autocomplete addresses on search, show satellite images of addresses, as well as to pull latitude / lontitude data for addresses
- **[Google Solar API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/solar/overview)**: Used to calculate approximate roof square footage to automatically generate an estimate for the full roof replacement. 

**Application Development**
- **[React](https://react.dev/)**: Employed to build the interactive and dynamic front-end user interfaces.
- **[Next.JS](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs)**: Leveraged for server-side rendering and building static websites, enhancing the performance and SEO of the front-end.
- **[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: Served as the primary database for storing user data, image generation history, and other essential information.
- **[Javascript](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)**: Used for scripting on the client-side, enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of the web application.
- **[Github](https://github.com/)**: Used for source code management, version control, and collaborative development of the project.


## Communication and Leadership

During the Amcat Roofing project, my role in communication and leadership was crucial and significantly contributed to the project's success. Key contributions included:

- **Project Management**: Led a team of four developers, coordinating tasks, pull requests, code reviews, and testing to maintain project momentum and quality.
  
- **Technical Architecture**: Architected the system and authored the Product Requirements Document (PRD), reviewed with stakeholders and developers for a solid plan and approach, followed by task breakdowns and implementation strategizing.
  
- **Daily Communication**: Ensured consistent daily communication with the team, maintaining a clear understanding of project objectives and progress, thus aligning efforts and keeping all members informed and focused.
  
- **Regular Update Schedule**: Established a three-day update cycle for thorough project monitoring and stakeholder information relay, enabling timely feedback and adjustments.
  
- **Strategic Meetings and Discussions**: Participated in key meetings, addressing critical aspects such as calculating roof replacement estimates and how to pull approximate roof square footage from solar imagery. I also led demos and was pivotal in decision-making and project tailoring for the target audience.
  
- **In-depth Analysis and Requirements Gathering**: Conducted thorough analysis and revisited call notes for precise project requirements understanding, aligning the project with its goals and user expectations.
  
- **Collaborative Planning and Implementation**: Actively collaborated in planning and implementing the core UI flow and product rollout strategy. 

In summary, my communication and leadership were integral to the effective management and successful delivery of the Amcat Roofing project, ensuring seamless integration of all project aspects with the strategic goals.
