# VitalFew - AI-powered Recruiting Platform - Project Summary

VitalFew is an innovative SaaS recruiting platform designed to revolutionize the recruitment process by integrating AI-driven automation. Delivered in July of 2024, this platform automates candidate communication and pre-screening, using voice AI to streamline the initial stages of recruitment and optimize human recruiter interactions.

At a high-level, companies can use VitalFew to quickly call hundreds of applicants and pre-screen them to see if they meet the minimum requirements for the job and then schedule them for a screening interview with a human recruiter or hiring manager.

This summary encapsulates my contributions to the project, highlighting the technological innovations and collaborative effort that went into its successful delivery.
